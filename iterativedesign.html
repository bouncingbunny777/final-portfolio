                        Apply Design is a <mark>modern online editor for property sellers that enables users to apply virtual staging</mark> on images of their home.

                        The company claims to help users sell their homes <mark>30% faster at a 5% higher price</mark> by showcasing the home in a more personalized setting to buyers, without the hassle of hiring an interior design team. So far, more than 100,000 images have been created through Apply Design for over 10,000 properties in 25 different countries by top realtors from Keller Williams, Re/Max, and other distinguished real estate franchises.

                        Upon creating the initial sketches, I discussed my designs with a group of peers to determine whether they addressed the company's needs. The company's main goal is to create a user-friendly experience for homeowners to virtually stage their homes. Thus, we determined that <mark>two must-have pages are a Create page where the user creates their design and a Gallery page where the user can view previous examples</mark>. In addition, we also included a Home page to introduce the website and an About page to introduce the company itself. With these four pages in mind, we used Figma to create a low-fidelity prototype.                    </h2>

                        After creating this prototype, I participated in <mark>a mockup crit and received feedback from our peers and UI/UX industry experts</mark>. The main feedback I received was for the Create page. Users felt that the flow from importing an image to creating a design should be more clear. Specifically, one comment was that users should not be able to choose different pieces of furniture without having imported a photo yet. Furthermore, users suggested that pop-up screens included X-buttons to exit the pop-up. Lastly, one user mentioned that the ability to switch between a 2-D view and a 3-D view would be helpful for visual staging.

Specifcally, I redesigned the Create page to show a <mark>clearer flow</mark>. Users first have to import an image before choosing any furniture. Then, they can switch between a 2-D view and a 3-D view to stage their home. In addition, users can preview and download their finalized designs or remove the photo to create a new design. In the About page, I removed the social media icons to avoid repetition.

They were able to successfully complete each of the tasks assigned to them. Referencing the different tasks outlined in the previous section, users spent the most time and made the most clicks on the fourth task â€“ walking through the process of creating a design. This result aligned with my expectations because the Create section contains the most number of pop-up screens and interactions. The <mark>main error that users made was attempting to drag the furniture</mark> they chose to their imported image when creating the design. Since the website is only a prototype, it does not support the actual design functionality yet. However, I hope that the progress can help Apply Design better understand different users' needs and potentially include parts of our design when implementing their Create page.                    </h2>

It was very interesting to collaborate on Figma in real time and work on different parts of the design at the same time. Additionally, I learned about how critiques work in the real world through different critique session with an industry expert.
